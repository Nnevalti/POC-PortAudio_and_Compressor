# POC - PortAudio, WAV Recorder and compressor

This repository is a sandbox, I used it first to make a simple in/out audio stream between two audio device. I then added a WAV Recorder that creates a WAV file based on the audio stream passing through my callback function.
Finally I started to develop a peak audio compressor, it's still a work in progress.
